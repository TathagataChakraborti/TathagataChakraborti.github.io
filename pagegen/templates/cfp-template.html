The Robotics Track welcomes research contributions in the general areas of planning and scheduling (P&S), which relate to the advancement of intelligent robots. P&S models and techniques are important for enabling autonomous, flexible, and interactive behaviors in robotic systems. A deep integration of these methods into robotic architectures can assist their effective deployment. In this direction, the ICAPS-2019 Robotics track provides an opportunity for the planning and robotics communities to share research progress in the area of robot planning and showcase the use of planning and scheduling technology in robotics applications.

<br>
<br>

Submission of papers that have been demonstrated on actual robotic systems or those that focus on impacting real-world application domains (e.g. logistics, transportation, manufacturing, etc.) are specifically encouraged.

In 2019, ICAPS will run a Planning and Learning track as part of the main conference. 
Machine learning has impacted all aspects of Artificial Intelligence and 
Computer Science, and planning is no exception. This new track provides 
an opportunity for the AI planning and scheduling community to engage 
directly with developments in the learning community for the benefit of 
both.

<br>
<br>

The Planning and Learning track aims to present research at the 
intersection of the fields of machine learning and planning & 
scheduling. In particular, we are interested in work that draws 
substantially from the objectives, techniques, or methodologies of both 
fields. Topics include, but are not limited to:

<ul>
<li> Reinforcement learning </li>
<li> Learning to improve the effectiveness of planning & scheduling systems </li>
<li> Learning domain models </li>
<li> Planning & scheduling in learned domain models </li>
<li> Learning effective heuristics and other forms of control knowledge </li>
<li> Planning applied to automating machine learning systems </li>
<li> Applications that involve a combination of learning with planning or scheduling </li>
</ul>

All submissions will be made electronically, through the EasyChair conference system:
<a href="https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icaps2019" target="_blank" class="text-dark">https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icaps2019</a>.
Submitted PDFs should be anonymous for double-blind and follow the AAAI author kit instructions for formatting.

<br>
<br>
Authors may submit long papers (8 pages plus up to one page of references) or short papers (4 pages plus up to one page of references). The type and track of the paper must be indicated at submission time.

Both long and short papers will be reviewed against the standard criteria of relevance, originality, significance, clarity and soundness, and are expected to meet the high standards set by ICAPS. Short papers may be of narrower scope. For example, they can either address a highly specific issue, or propose/evaluate a small, yet important, extension of previous work or a new idea.

<br>
<br>
Authors making multiple submissions must ensure that each submission has significant unique content. Papers submitted to ICAPS 2019 may not be submitted to other conferences or journals during the ICAPS 2019 review period, nor may be already under review or published in other conferences or journals. Over-length papers will be rejected without review.

<br>
<br>
In addition to the submitted PDF paper, authors can submit supplementary material (videos, technical proofs, additional experimental results) for their paper. Please make sure that the supporting material is also anonymized. Papers should be self-contained; reviewers are encouraged, but not obligated, to consider supporting material in their decision.

<br>
<br>
The proceedings will be published by AAAI Press. All accepted papers will be published in the main conference proceedings and will be presented orally at the conference (full papers will be allocated more time).
