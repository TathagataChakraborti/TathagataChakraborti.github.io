<h5 class="text-left">Overview</h5>
</li>
</ol>

Application domains that contain planning and scheduling (P&amp;S) problems present a set of interesting challenges to the AI planning and scheduling community -- from modelling to technical to institutional issues. New real-world domains and problems are becoming increasingly affordable for AI and P&S techniques. The international Scheduling and Planning Applications woRKshop (SPARK) series was established to foster the practical application of advances made in the AI P&amp;S community.

<ol class="breadcrumb breadcrumb-header">
<li class="breadcrumb-item breadcrumb-item-primary">
<h5 class="text-left">Workshop Aim</h5>
</li>
</ol>

The   workshop series aims to provide a stable forum on relevant topics connected to application-focused research and the deployment of P&amp;S systems. 
The immediate legacy began in 2007 with the ICAPS'07 Workshop on "Moving Planning and Scheduling Systems into the Real World", and continued in 2008-2018 with successful yearly editions. 2019 is the 12th edition of SPARK. 
 
<br>
<br>
The websites of the previous editions of SPARK are available at <a href="http://decsai.ugr.es/~lcv/SPARK" target="_blank">http://decsai.ugr.es/~lcv/SPARK</a>. These workshops presented a stimulating environment where researchers could discuss the opportunity and challenges in moving P&S developments into practice, and analyze domains and problem instances under study for, or closely inspired by, real industrial/commercial deployment of P&S techniques.
 
<br>
<br>
The challenges and discussions that emerged in the last years' editions set the baseline for this year's SPARK workshop. A goal of the workshop series is the definition of a longer term set of challenges that could be of benefit for the research community as well as practitioners. SPARK is the ideal incubator to test, discuss, mature and improve potential papers for that main track with the feedback of an excellent audience, and great place for the inception of new applications and challenges.
 
<br>
<br>
Authors of accepted papers will be encouraged to share their domains and instances, or parts of them, towards a library of practical benchmarking problems that could also be useful for the community.

<br>
<br>
Accepted papers will be presented in plenary or poster sessions during the workshop.  Each presented paper will receive comments from a designated moderator, in order to start the discussion at the workshop.

<ol class="breadcrumb breadcrumb-header">

<h5 class="text-left">Format</h5>
</li>
</ol>

Starting from the results of the previous editions, SPARK'19 will deepen the debate on application-relevant aspects of P&amp;S theory and practice, with the aim of reporting and discussing experiences relating to deploying P&S systems.
 
<br>
<br>
Topics of the workshop include, but are not limited to:
<ul> 
<li>
Novel domains and benchmark or challenge problems
</li>
<li>
Experiences in deploying P&S systems, from their conception to their maturity in practice
</li>
<li>
Comparison with previously existing technologies and/or systems
</li>
