</li>
</ol>

Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) concerns the challenge of shedding light on opaque models in contexts for which transparency is important, i.e. where these models could be used to solve analysis or synthesis tasks. In particular, as AI is increasingly being adopted into application solutions, the challenge of supporting interaction with humans is becoming more apparent. Partly this is to support integrated working styles, in which humans and intelligent systems cooperate in problem-solving, but also it is a necessary step in the process of building trust as humans migrate greater competence and responsibility to such systems. The challenge is to find effective ways to characterise, and to communicate, the foundations of AI-driven behaviour, when the algorithms that drive it are far from transparent to humans. While XAI at large is primarily concerned with learning-based approaches, model-based approaches are well suited -- arguably better suited -- for explanation, and Explainable AI Planning (XAIP) can play an important role in addressing complex decision-making procedures.

<br>
<br>
After the success of previous workshops on XAI and XAIP, the mission of this workshop is to mature and broaden the XAIP community, fostering continued exchange on XAIP topics at ICAPS.

<ol class="breadcrumb breadcrumb-header">
<li class="breadcrumb-item breadcrumb-item-primary">
<h5 class="text-left">Topics</h5>
</li>
</ol>

The workshop invites contributions on all aspects relating to XAIP as a broadly construed concept. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

<ul>
<li>
Frameworks for defining meaningful explanations in planning &amp; scheduling contexts;
</li>
<li>
Representation, organization, and memory content used in explanation;
</li>
<li>
The creation of such content during plan generation or understanding;
</li>
<li>
Generation and evaluation of explanations;
</li>
<li>
The explanation process, i.e. the way in which explanations are communicated to humans (e.g., plan summaries, answers to questions);
</li>
<li>
The role of knowledge and learning in explainable planners;
</li>
<li>
Human vs AI models in explanations;
</li>
<li>
Links between explainable planning and other disciplines (e.g. social science, argumentation);
</li>
<li>
Model differences and model reconciliation;
</li>
<li>
Goal reasoning and plan explanations;
</li>
<li>
Excuse generation, unsolvability and explanations;
</li>
<li>
Use cases and applications of explainable planning.
</li>
</ul>

<ol class="breadcrumb breadcrumb-header">
<li class="breadcrumb-item breadcrumb-item-primary">
<h5 class="text-left">Submissions</h5>
</li>
</ol>

Given the novelty of XAIP as an area, we invite several different kinds of submissions: 

<ul>
<li>
full technical papers, making an original contribution; up to 9 pages including references;
</li>
<li>
short technical papers, making an original contribution; up to 5 pages including references;
</li>
<li>
position papers, proposing XAIP challenges, outlining XAIP ideas, debating issues relevant to XAIP; up to 5 pages including references.
</li>
</ul>

Please format submissions in AAAI style (see instructions in the Author Kit at <a href="http://www.aaai.org/Publications/Templates/AuthorKit18.zip" target="_blank">http://www.aaai.org/Publications/Templates/AuthorKit18.zip</a>). Authors considering submitting to the workshop papers rejected from the main conference, please ensure you do your utmost to address the comments given by ICAPS reviewers. Please do not submit papers that are already accepted for the main conference to the workshop.

<br>
<br>
Every submission will be reviewed by members of the program committee according to the usual criteria such as relevance to the workshop, significance of the contribution, and technical quality. The review process will be single-blind: the authors' identity will be known to the reviewers, but not vice versa. Details about the submission process will be made available soon.

<br>
<br>
Submissions sent to other conferences are allowed if this does not interfere with their submission rules. Submissions under double-blind review in another conference (in particular IJCAI-19) must be anonymous. 

<br>
<br>
The workshop is meant to be an open and inclusive forum, and we encourage papers that report on work in progress or that do not fit the mold of a typical conference paper.

<br>
<br>
At least one author of each accepted paper must attend the workshop in order to present the paper. Authors must register for the ICAPS main conference in order to attend the workshop. There will be no separate workshop-only registration.
