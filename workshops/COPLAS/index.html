</li>
</ol>

The workshop aims at providing a forum to discuss novel issues on planning, scheduling, and constraint satisfaction problems. Solutions to many real-world problems need to integrate plan synthesis capabilities with time and resource allocation, which can be efficiently managed by constraint satisfaction and OR techniques. Formulations of P&S problems as CSPs, resource and temporal global constraints, and inference techniques are of particular interest of COPLAS.

</ol>

The areas of AI planning and scheduling have seen important advances thanks to the application of constraint satisfaction models and techniques. Especially solutions to many real-world problems need to integrate plan synthesis capabilities with resource allocation, which can be efficiently managed by using constraint satisfaction techniques. The workshop will aim at providing a forum for researchers in the field of Artificial Intelligence to discuss novel issues on planning, scheduling, constraint programming/constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) and many other common areas that exist among them. On the whole, the workshop will mainly focus on managing complex problems where planning, scheduling and constraint satisfaction must be combined and/or interrelated, which entails an enormous potential for practical applications and future research. COPLAS is ranked as CORE B in ERA Conference Ranking and it is covered in selected Elsevier database products.

We are pleased to accept papers based on recent publications from other (non ICAPS) venues such as specialized conferences (CP, CP-AI-OR, AAMAS, ...), or general AI conferences (AAAI, IJCAI, ECAI, ...). This must be however clearly indicated in the submitted paper. Submission of papers that are under review in another forum is allowed and encouraged for wider dissemination as COPLAS will have informal proceedings only (but double check the submission conditions of the other conference).
At least one author of each accepted paper must attend the workshop in order to present the paper. Authors must register for the ICAPS main conference in order to attend the workshop. There will be no separate workshop-only registration.


<ol class="breadcrumb breadcrumb-header">

<h5 class="text-left">Submissions</h5>
</li>
</ol>

Papers must be prepared according to the instructions for ICAPS-19 (in AAAI format) available at <a href="http://www.aaai.org/Publications/Author/author.php" target="_blank">http://www.aaai.org/Publications/Author/author.php</a> and must be no more than ten (10) pages long, including figures and bibliography. Submitted PDF papers should be anonymous for double-blind reviewing and should be sent via the EasyChair conference system (<a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=coplas2019" target="_blank">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=coplas2019</a>). 
Every submitted paper will be reviewed by at least two members of the Program Committee. Late submissions must be consulted with the workshop organizers prior the submission deadline.
Accepted papers will be included in the workshop notes.
