<h5 class="text-left">Overview</h5>
</li>
</ol>

The field of Reasoning about Actions and Change (RAC) is a fundamental area of Knowledge Representation. In recent years, RAC moved from standard forms of reasoning, such as action sequence executability and future effects (projection), to more sophisticated forms of reasoning which share many commonalities with other fields of CS, from verification in Formal Methods to process modeling and analysis in Business Process Management. Connections between RAC and planning have naturally existed since the early beginnings of both areas. Generalized planning and synthesis, MDPs/RL, supervisory control, are all areas that are both related to planning and RAC. However, papers from these various areas are dispersed across many conferences, which makes it difficult to follow the general direction of the field. Drawing upon a successful format followed in other fields (e.g., <a href="http://highlights-conference.org" target="_blank">http://highlights-conference.org</a>), the workshop aims to offer a wide picture of the latest research in the field and a chance to meet everybody in the community.

<h5 class="text-left">Goal</h5>
</li>
</ol>

This workshop aims to bring together researchers working in ares related to reasoning about actions, verification, synthesis, and RL, particularly those interested in the connections between two or more of these areas.

<ol class="breadcrumb breadcrumb-header">
<li class="breadcrumb-item breadcrumb-item-primary">
<h5 class="text-left">Format</h5>
</li>
</ol>

We invite submissions for presentations, not papers. We welcome a presentation on your favorite recent technical work, position paper, or open problems with clear and concise formulations of current challenges. We hope to have 15 minute presentations, at least one keynote talk, and a panel, but time and space restrictions for all ICAPS-19 workshops may require us to modify the format. Sessions will be designed to promote interaction between the attendees by holding frequent discussion periods for analysis and critique.

<ol class="breadcrumb breadcrumb-header">
<li class="breadcrumb-item breadcrumb-item-primary">
<h5 class="text-left">Submissions</h5>
</li>
</ol>

Submissions should have a single main author, who will be the speaker, and each speaker can have no more than one submission. Each submission must be 1 or 2 pages long including references (use the ICAPS 2019 style), and may refer to joint work with other collaborators to be credited in the presentation. There are no formal proceedings and we encourage submissions of work presented or submitted elsewhere (no copyright transfer is required, only permission to post the abstract on the workshop site).

Topics of interest include but are not limited to:

<ul>
<li>
Reasoning about actions
</li>
<li>
Representing and reasoning about processes
</li>
<li>
Hierarchical abstractions of action models
</li>
<li>
Generalized planning
</li>
<li>
Verification and Synthesis of high level agent behaviors
</li>
<li>
Agent behavior control
</li>
<li>
Logic-based representation, action theories, temporal logics, logics of programs
</li>
<li>
Stochastic representation, MDPs and Non Markovian Decision Processes
</li>
<li>
Learning dynamic behaviors, RL
</li>
<li>
Partial observability, incomplete information, uncertainty
</li>
<li>
Reasoning about beliefs, goals and intentions
</li>
<li>
First-person vs third person view
</li>
<li>
