In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) decision-making and autonomous systems became an integrated part of the economy, industry, and society. The evolving economy of the human-AI ecosystem raising concerns regarding value bias and risks inherited in AI systems. The availability and the increasing demand for AI systems created many disciplines of expert systems addressing different aspects of the problem-solving process (e.g., different learning methods, data storage, information retrieval and more). However, this dividing the problem-solving process into components which are logically depended. The increasing efficiency of each such expert systems without effective guide toward practical problem solution creates gaps and value bias in the problem-solving process. Effective planning of a rational decision-making process is the natural tool to link and guide a divided process of problem-solving.

<br>
<br>
Planning and problem-solving are decision-making processes that consist of sequential decision choices and decision actions. Rational decision-making process comprises rational decision actions, and the entire process optimized in time and results in a global utility optimum. Decisions are the building block in most of the productive activities and every intelligent activity. Thinking and problem solving are naturally multidisciplinary and require different cognitive skills at different stages and contexts. A well-planned problem-solving process allows combining multi-disciplinary decisions to a practical solution. On the one hand, the non-atomic nature of the decision-making process is vulnerable to communication gaps. On the other hand, this serves a ground for multi-disciplinary collaboration to share ideas, tools, real-world challenges and mutual feedback on each other work.

<br>
<br>
This workshop intends to build a bridge between the many disciplines that practice planning, problem-solving and decision processes in the academic, industrial and economic environments. It is an opportunity to meet each-other abilities and needs and to build a platform to maintain an ongoing cross-fertilization of ideas and tools, to solve problems better and utilize planning tools.

A half-day workshop, organized in two sessions. The workshop will include invited talks, presentations of accepted papers and a multi-disciplinary panel on the challenges and gaps in real-world planning and problem-solving, communication channels and ongoing collaboration between different disciplines. A summary panel will discuss action-items and priorities for future research to sketch a collaborative plan/policy for future research.
