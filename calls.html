In 2019, ICAPS will run a Planning and Learning track as part of the main conference. 
Machine learning has impacted all aspects of Artificial Intelligence and 
Computer Science, and planning is no exception. This new track provides 
an opportunity for the AI planning and scheduling community to engage 
directly with developments in the learning community for the benefit of 
both.

<br>
<br>

The Planning and Learning track aims to present research at the 
intersection of the fields of machine learning and planning & 
scheduling. In particular, we are interested in work that draws 
substantially from the objectives, techniques, or methodologies of both 
fields. Topics include, but are not limited to:

<ul>
<li> Reinforcement learning </li>
<li> Learning to improve the effectiveness of planning & scheduling systems </li>
<li> Learning domain models </li>
<li> Planning & scheduling in learned domain models </li>
<li> Learning effective heuristics and other forms of control knowledge </li>
<li> Planning applied to automating machine learning systems </li>
<li> Applications that involve a combination of learning with planning or scheduling </li>
</ul>

The organizing committee of the 29th International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS 2019), to be held in Berkeley, CA USA, on July 11-12 2019, invites proposals for its workshop program. The workshops are intended to provide a forum to discuss research advances on a selected topic in an informal setting and to promote dissemination and collaboration on new planning and scheduling challenges.

<br>
<br>
Proposals in all areas related to AI planning and scheduling are welcome. ICAPS is also open to new topics beyond its traditional workshop offerings. For example, we encourage workshops that promote building bridges to other research communities working with similar technologies (e.g. verification, diagnosis, operations research, machine learning) or on related application problems (e.g. robotics or security).

<br>
<br>
The workshop (and tutorial) programs will comprise several concurrent events held in the two days before the plenary sessions of the conference. Workshop registration is free for ICAPS participants.

<br>
<br>
As in previous years, ICAPS supports the integration of the workshop and tutorial programs. Workshop organizers are welcome to also submit a tutorial proposal on a related topic. This tutorial would usually be scheduled in the morning of the workshop in the same room. We envisage that a full-day workshop will contain a quarter-day tutorial.

<br>
<br>
The preferred length for a workshop is half of a day, in order to encourage and promote the ability of participants to broaden and diversify their participation. The workshop format is open and may include oral presentations, talks by invited speakers, a poster session, a demo session, and others activities. Workshop organizers are encouraged to take initiatives that foster interaction and debate within the community.

<br>
<br>
We also encourage workshop organizers to partner with other workshop organizers if similar topics are covered in multiple workshops (e.g., joint sessions or invited talks).

<h5> Workshop Proposals </h5>


Workshop proposals should be no more than 3 pages and should provide:

<ul>
<li>A description of the workshop topic.</li>
<li>A brief discussion of why the topic is of interest to ICAPS at this time, and why the topic is not adequately addressed by other meetings or conferences.</li>
<li>If relevant, the title and speaker names for the tutorial to be attached to the workshop. A full tutorial proposal needs to be sent to the tutorial chairs (for details, see the separate call for tutorial proposals).</li>
<li>A brief description of the proposed workshop length and format. Innovative formats that aim to increase opportunities for discussion and interaction are encouraged.</li>
<li>Names and full contact information for the organizing committee, plus short descriptions of their relevant expertise. Strong proposals include organisers who bring differing perspectives to the workshop topic and who are actively connected to the communities of potential participants.</li>
<li>An estimate of the number of workshop speakers (including invited speakers, presenters, panelists, etc.) and the expected number of workshop attendees. Optionally, a list of proposed attendees that have indicated potential (non-binding) interest.</li>
</ul>



The organizers of accepted workshop proposals are responsible for:

<ul>
<li>Producing a Call for Participation (CfP) and contributing materials for setting up a web page for the workshop by December 28, 2018. The web page and the CfP will be linked to the ICAPS 2019 website.</li>
<li>Additional publicity, such as distributing the CFP to relevant newsgroups and electronic mailing lists (through liaison with the ICAPS 2019 publicity chairs) and especially to potential audiences outside the ICAPS community.</li>
<li>Organizing the review process for submissions and issuing invitations to participate in the workshop.</li>
<li>Formulating a detailed technical program for the workshop and making it available to be uploaded on the ICAPS 2019 website well in advance of the conference. A list of accepted papers for the workshop should be ready to be placed on the website by April 20, 2019.</li>
<li>Compiling a camera-ready copy for the workshop proceedings in close interaction with the workshop program chairs. The workshop proceedings will be made available on the ICAPS 2019 website.</li>
</ul>

The Organizing Committee for the 29th International Conference on 
Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS 2019) invites proposals for its 
Tutorial Program.  Tutorials offer the attendees a review of a specific 
subfield by a leading expert. Registration is free for ICAPS participants.

<br>
<br>

We welcome proposals in all areas related to AI planning and scheduling 
(P&S), and highly encourage topics that have not appeared in recent 
ICAPS tutorials. We especially welcome topics from outside the ICAPS 
community that merge P&S with other areas such as robotics, machine 
learning, autonomous agents, and knowledge representation. Tutorials 
typically begin with introductory material, but also review recent 
advances in the field, providing either breadth or depth into the 
specific P&S topic.

<br>
<br>

We encourage tutorials that (i) include a hands-on session, allowing 
participants to experience useful tools, or (ii) experiment with 
algorithmic components, to deepen the participantsâ understanding of the 
topic. We especially welcome tutorials that collaborate with a workshop, 
such that the tutorial provides some introductory material that can be 
later discussed at the workshop.

<br>
<br>

We expect the majority of tutorials to be half-day but quarter-day (90 
minutes) tutorials are also possible.  There is limited space for 
tutorials this year, so it is strongly recommended for tutorial 
proposals to integrate with an existing workshop if possible. Questions 
on integrating with a workshop can be directed to the tutorial co-chairs.


<br>

<h5>
Submission Details
</h5>

Tutorial proposals of up to 2 pages should include the tutorialâs title, 
type (advanced or introductory), summary, outline, and expected length 
(quarter or half-day) of the tutorial, as well as a short CV of the 
proposer(s), including a list of significant publications or prior 
teaching experience.

<br>
<br>

Please email a PDF to both the Tutorial Chairs with subject "Tutorial 
Proposal for ICAPS-19" by February 15th, 2019.  Organizers will be 
notified by email of the acceptance or rejection of their proposal by 
March 1, 2019.

The Organizing Committee of the International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS 2019) invites Ph.D. students to participate in this year's Doctoral Consortium.  The DC is open to all doctoral student attendees of the conference.  The aim of the DC program is to provide a forum for students to discuss their research with other students and senior researchers working in similar areas, provide general advice regarding research skills and careers, and generally to accelerate the cohesion of new researchers with the ICAPS community and nurture the future of the field. Registering for the Doctoral Consortium will be part of the registration process for the conference.  

<br>
<br>
We also encourage current doctoral students (students whose Ph.D. is in progress, but who are at least a year from defense/completion) to apply for the Mentoring Program that will take place as part of the Doctoral Consortium. The Mentoring Program is designed to provide senior graduate students with an opportunity to in-depth advice about their receive advice and mentoring by senior members of the field regarding careers and research skills.  Participants in the mentoring program will also present posters during the main ICAPS conference in a session open to all ICAPS participants. The Mentoring Program will take place as part of the ICAPS 2019 Doctoral Consortium, which will be held on July, 10, the day before tutorials and workshops. Students do not need to be accepted into the Mentoring Program to attend and participate in the Doctoral Consortium.

<br>
<h5>
Student Funding
</h5>

ICAPS will provide student support partly covering travel and/or registration costs through a separate scholarship application process. Students are not required to apply for the Mentoring Program to be considered for this support. Participation in the DC, however, is a requirement for students receiving travel assistance (as are some light service tasks during the conference).

The program committee of the 29th International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS) invites submissions of published journal papers for the Journal Presentation Track, successfully initiated in 2014.

The track is designed to provide a forum to discuss important results related to automated planning and scheduling that appeared recently (from March 2018 onwards) in selective journals, but have not been previously presented either at ICAPS or at any other major AI conference (such as IJCAI, AAAI, ECAI).

The goal of this track is twofold:

<ul>
<li>
To provide authors an opportunity to present at the conference important results published in journals that might otherwise not be submitted to the conference due to their length and complexity. Papers that differ from traditional ICAPS format and topics are welcome.
</li>
<li>
To broaden the program with lines of work at the intersection between planning/scheduling and related fields such as for example constraint programming, operations research, control, knowledge representation and reasoning, machine learning, multi-agent systems, robotics, computer games, and cognitive science. Papers that use planning and scheduling in some innovative way (even if they do not advance the planning technology itself) are welcome.
</li>
</ul>

<h5>
Paper Presentation
</h5>

All accepted journal presentations will be presented orally during the conference - at least one author is expected to register to ICAPS 2019 and to present the paper in person. Complete citations, abstracts and URLs of the original journal papers (if available from the publisher) will be published at ICAPS 2019 web site as a permanent reference.

<br>
<br>

<h5>
Submission Requirements
</h5>

Journal track submissions must meet the following criteria:

<ul>
<li>
Candidate papers must be published in a journal such as (but not limited to) AIJ, AURO, JAIR, JAAMAS, KER and other leading journals relevant to each research area from March 2018 until  the submission deadline.
</li>
<li>
Papers that are in press may be submitted as long as the final camera-ready version is available.
</li>
<li>
Extensions of papers that have been previously presented at ICAPS or another major AI conference (such as IJCAI, AAAI, ECAI) may be submitted to this track.  However, submissions will be reviewed upon the strength of the new content.
</li>
</ul>

<h5>
Submission Process
</h5>

All submissions will be done via EasyChair (<a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icaps2019" target="_blank">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icaps2019</a>). The submission will be in the following format (please include all elements other than the title and abstract as a single PDF):

<ul>
<li>
Title of the original journal paper (to be published on the Web)
</li>
<li>
Complete reference of the original paper (to be published on the Web)
</li>
<li>
URL where the paper can be downloaded from the publisher if available, or alternatively a preprint (to be published on the Web)
</li>
<li>
Abstract of the paper (to be published on the Web)
</li>
<li>
An accompanying letter containing a brief summary of the key results and contributions as well as an explanation of why this paper is interesting to the ICAPS community
</li>
<li>
A copy of the paper with its final camera-ready contents
</li>
</ul>

Submissions will go through an expedited selection process led by the track chairs. Selection criteria include significance of the results, relevance to the planning and scheduling community, and contribution to diversification of traditional ICAPS topics.

The System Demonstrations and Exhibits program at ICAPS 2019 provides an opportunity for planning and scheduling researchers and practitioners to demonstrate their state-of-the-art implementations in action. This event allows the community to experience some of the latest contributions to the field, while broadening the reach of novel methods.

<br>
<br>
Researchers from all sub-areas of AI planning and scheduling are encouraged to submit proposals to demonstrate their systems. Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of their novelty; scientific or industrial contributions' relevance to the conference theme and to users; and presentation. We encourage submissions demonstrating new and innovative techniques for planning and scheduling, as well as submissions from mature, commercial and/or deployed systems, and systems in development. Tools for teaching planning or scheduling are also welcome.

<br>
<br style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
There will be an award for Best System Demonstration.


<h5>
Submission Instructions
</h5>

Potential exhibitors should submit their applications via EasyChair, at <a href="https://easychair.org/my/conference.cgi?conf=icaps19demo" target="_blank">https://easychair.org/my/conference.cgi?conf=icaps19demo</a>.

The submission should be a zip or compressed tar archive containing the following:

<ul>
<li>
An extended abstract of no more than 2 pages in the AAAI format. This should include the title of the proposed demonstration, the list of authors and their affiliations, and an abstract of up to 250 words. It should describe the technical content of the demonstration, with the appropriate credits and references.
</li>
<li>
A storyboard describing the proposed demonstration, submitted as a presentation of up to 10 slides in PowerPoint or PDF format, or as a URL link to a video no more than 2 minutes long, in any commonly-used format other than Flash or WMV (i.e., don't make us download a plugin to play it). The storyboard will be the primary basis for evaluating the suitability and merit of the proposed demonstration.
</li>
<li>
A description of any non-standard hardware or software requirements, or other requested logistical arrangements. We plan to provide for each demonstration a table, chairs, poster board, power strip, and a large display, but will try to accommodate special requests. WiFi will be available at the venue, but experience suggests not to rely on it working properly unless absolutely necessary.
</li>
</ul>

The extended abstracts for accepted demonstrations will be available to conference participants and will be archived on the conference website.
